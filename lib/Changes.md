## lib/es6

### This is the directory where you should make your changes.

This directory is used by `gulp` to generate the `lib/js` directory.

* Any new javascript files created should be given the extension `.es` or `.es6`
  * These files will be transpiled into the `lib/js` directory with the same name but with the `.js` extension
* Files deleted in this directory will cause their corresponding file in the `lib/js` directory to be deleted as well

## lib/js

### This is a generated directory. Changes made here are liable to be overwritten.

This directory is generated by transpiling code written in the `lib/es6` directory.

* To generate the directory, run the `gulp` command
* To watch for changes in the `lib/es6` directory, run the `gulp watch` command.
